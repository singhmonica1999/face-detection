HAAR CASCADE FRONTAL FACE ALGORITHM
-uses haarwavelet technique to analyze the pixels in image as square  .....This uses machine learning techniques to get a high degree of accuracy from what is called “training data”. 
1....Load HaarCascadeFace Algorithm
2....read frames from camera
3....convert bgr to gray color format
4....obtain face coordinates by passing algorithm
5.....drawing rectangle on face coordinates
6.. dispalay the output frame
